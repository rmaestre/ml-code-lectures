# ML Code lectures

This repo has been implemented from scratch and serves as base to the PhD and MSc courses that I have imparted on Bussines and Data Science. The final goal is to provide a low-level details for classic ML models and also providing good programming concepts such OOP, recursion and Big O notions. 

Theory, notebooks with explanations, bussines concepts and practices are not included here.

## Models (WIP)

* Kmeans
* Neuron (classification)
* Decision Tree (clasification and regression)
* Random Forest (with feature importance)
* MLP (nnfs) (Cross-entropy loss function)
* Isolation Forest
* - Knn
* - Lineal regression
* - General Additive Models
* - Multinomial Naive Bayes
